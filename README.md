<h1>Budget-program</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Basic python GUI that is used to keep track of my budgeting by seperating my entered pay into 3 different virtual accounts.
Each account can be tracked through adding and taking money.

Python learning aspects covered in this project include object orientated design, tkinter GUI, file IO, error handling
<br><br>
This project was finished up January 2021, mainly used as a basis for exploration into tkinter GUI.
